I knew I needed to outsource checking all the possible rules of a nonterminal
to a separate function from the one that tries to match an individual rule. I
originally separated them before deciding to nest one in the other to make
mutual recursion easier. I put the nonterminal checking one on the outside
because the final solution to the problem uses it, starting with the start
symbol.
